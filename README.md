### Hi there, I am Greg Lee ðŸ‘‹

:computer: I am an open source developer at [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/) who also works on [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/) projects.

:microscope: I am a core maintainer of [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [PyWavelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and contributor to many other scientific software projects. 

:boom: I co-created the [RAPIDS cuCIM](https://github.com/rapidsai/cucim) project for GPU-accelerated image processing via a scikit-image compatible API. This relies on the excellent [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) project.

:school: I have a doctorate in biomedical engineering and worked for a number of years as a [researcher in magnetic reonance imaging (MRI)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=coICoqQAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). I have a general interest in the area of medical imaging and image processing.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about contributing to open source projects or how you can accelerate your image/data analysis workflows.
